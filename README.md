# Speech Emotion Recognition & Chatbot

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a project titled **Speech Emotion Recognition & Chatbot**. The system integrates advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to:
- Recognize emotions from speech using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
- Provide an empathetic and supportive chatbot interface for emotional well-being.

## Features
- **Emotion Recognition**: Detects seven emotions (anger, contempt, fear, joy, neutrality, sadness, and surprise) from audio input.
- **Chatbot Functionality**: Conversational interface providing empathetic and context-aware responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Flask and HTML templates for a seamless user experience.
- **Personalization**: Leverages detected emotions to offer tailored suggestions and coping mechanisms.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Flask (Python), Express.js (Node.js)
- **Libraries**:
  - Audio Processing: `librosa`, `numpy`, `pandas`
  - Machine Learning: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS
- **Tools**:
  - Data Preprocessing: `librosa`, `sklearn`
  - Deployment: Node.js server for chatbot API
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
